            The story of the relationship between Ross Geller
            <span>(David Schwimmer)</span> and Rachel Green
            <span>(Jennifer Aniston)</span> began in the first episode of
            "Friends" and logically ended in the last - 236. For 10 years, the
            heroes hid mutual sympathy, confessed their love, parted, hurt each
            other and even hated each other. In the final, however, they still
            ended up together In the eighth season, Rachel confessed to friends
            that she was pregnant, but refused to reveal the name of the child's
            father. It turned out to be Ross. At the end of the season, Rachel
            and Ross had a daughter, Emma. The heroes converged again in the
            final episode of the series: Rachel decided to leave her new job in
            Paris and stay in New York with Ross.

            For the first 4 seasons, Monica Geller
            <span>(Courteney Cox)</span> and Chandler Bing
            <span>(Matthew Perry)</span> were separately looking for life
            partners. Chandler dated a strange girl Janice
            <span>(Maggie Wheeler)</span>, and Monica met eye doctor Richard
            <span>(Tom Selleck)</span>, a friend of her parents, But Janice
            cheated on Chandler with her ex-husband, and Richard made it clear
            that he did not want to have children, and for Monica this became a
            reason to disperse. In the fifth season during the trip of friends
            to Ross and Emily's wedding in London, they woke up in the same bed.
            Chandler and Monica decided not to be limited to one night and
            continued their relationship, and then began to live together. In
            the seventh season, they got married and decided to adopt. The
            couple decided to become parents for the child of a young girl Erica
            <span>(Anna Faris)</span> from Ohio, who accidentally became
            pregnant and was not ready to become a single mother. Erica gave
            birth in the last episode of season 10 - however, not one child, but
            twins, which came as a surprise to everyone, including Erica
            herself. In the finale, they moved from an apartment in New York to
            a large house in the suburbs.

            The story of Phoebe Buffet <span>(Lisa Kudrow)</span> was full of
            tragic moments, despite this she maintained a positive attitude and
            was one of the funniest in the company of friends. Last season she
            found her by accepting a marriage proposal from Mike Hannigan
            <span>(Paul Rudd)</span> - a guy from a rich family, whom Joey
            accidentally introduced to Phoebe, who forgot to find a mate for
            Phoebe during their double date. It was marriage that played an
            important role in the history of the heroine. In season 10, she
            finally found a loved one and was able to forget about her difficult
            youth.

            Joey Tribbiani <span>(Matt LeBlanc)</span> dreamed of becoming a
            famous actor. And if Joey did not have a stable relationship by the
            end of Friends, then his career did work out. In the second season,
            he got an important role in the popular American soap opera "Days of
            Our Lives", but in the same season his character was killed by the
            writers, angry at Joe's words that he was writing his own lines. In
            the seventh season, Joe managed to return to "Days of Our Lives" -
            after his character was resurrected through a brain transplant.
            After that, Joey managed to star in several feature films and small
            series. And after the completion of "Friends", as we know from the
            spin-off "Joey", the hero went from New York to Los Angeles to his
            sister to conquer Hollywood and had a serious relationship with a
            woman
